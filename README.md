Here's some data engineering code for public access.

API_GET is a proyect that consist in quering and endpoint, using a python script app_get.py and it's private config stored in the config.json.

The entities that can be queried are transactions such as cases and their interactions (activities), dynamic dimmensions such as users (contacts) and static dimmensions such as case types.

The script allows to set up how long back the user needs to query data, how frequent, and where to store it.
